I recently became a father and have been experiencing what everyone always warns you about, sleep deprivation. Refusing to be beaten by a baby, I had the idea to build The Hungry Baby Alarm, which could alert me when my baby was likely to cry for food soon. The idea hinges on the ability to bottle feed my baby before he cries, waking everyone up.

Check out the project:

I have plans to clean up the code and make it slightly easier to use beyond my specific system, and plan [to open source this project soon][github]. Stay tuned on that front.

This project hits on a more personal level with some people, in tampering with some pretty well established biological processes. It has been interesting to see feedback, and how it varies depending on the source. This project also found its way into [Gizmodo][gizmodo].
