Most of my projects come from brainstorming sessions, however this one was requested by my wife. She was getting mildly annoyed not remembering when our baby woke up, so she could use that information to have a better idea when our baby is likely to go down for his next nap.

She asked me to "build an app" that remembers when our baby woke up, so here it is, with a side of overengineering. It's not an entirely novel idea, there are products in the marketplace that do this, and are likely more polished. However, I believe this as the cheapest automated baby sleep tracking service that exists.

Check out the project:

I [open sourced the whole project][project-code]. Feel free to pull it down and try it.
